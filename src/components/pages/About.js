      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      I graduated from UC Davis in 2018 with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science. After graduating, I moved back to my hometown San Diego.
      I work part-time as a social media manager for a small company. I am currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp with the UC San Diego extension.
      In my free time I enjoy listening to music, playing chess, playing tennis, and cooking.
