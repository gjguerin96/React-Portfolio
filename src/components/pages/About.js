      I graduated from UC Davis in 2018 with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science. After graduating, I moved back to my hometown San Diego. 
      I am currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp with the UC San Diego extension. I work part-time as a social media manager for a small company.

      My work experience includes a variety of qualititavie and quantivative research, as well as several different types of writing. 
      I previously interned with a nonprofit focused on reducing global poverty, and hope to work with more nonprofits in the future. 
      In my free time I enjoy listening to music, playing chess, playing tennis, and cooking.
